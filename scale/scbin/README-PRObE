Instructions for working on PRObE cluster 

1. Generate machine list by running `gen_nmc_machine.sh`
gen_nmc_machine.sh receives the number of machines as the first
argument. Sometime some machines in the cluster cannot start up, and
we do not want to use those machines, we can tell gen_nmc_machine.sh
to skip involving them by writing their indexes into a file name
`skiplist`. The format is one index number per line.

2. Customize scdeploy.conf
For num_node variable, we should assign 1 to it (this variable
specifies how many processes in one machine). And each time we swap in
PRObE experiment, we have to re-enter new value of observed_nodes.

3. Set up operating directory
Set up operating directory for every machine in our running by running
`cluster_dir_setup`. We have to call this on the machine in the cluster
not kodiak machine (e.g. node-1.scale.ucare-kodiak.nx).

4. Run Cassandra
Running `cluster_start`
